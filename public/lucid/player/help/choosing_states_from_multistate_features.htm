<h1>Choosing  states from multistate features</h1>
<p>In Lucid, all states in <i>Features 
 Available</i> are provided with checkboxes. Choose a state by clicking 
 on its checkbox. Entities that match the chosen state will remain in <i>Entities Remaining</i>; entities that do 
 not match will be moved to <i>Entities 
 Discarded</i>. The chosen state will also be displayed within the <i>Features 
 Chosen</i> list.</p>
 <p><b>Tip:</b> In Lucid keys, you may choose more than one state for any given feature. 
 For instance, if a key has a feature <i>Flower 
 colour</i> with states <i>white</i>, 
 <i>cream</i>, <i>yellow</i>, 
 <i>red</i>, and <i>blue</i>, 
 you may be unsure whether to choose the states <i>white</i> 
 or <i>cream</i> for your specimen. In 
 this case, choose both states. In normal identification mode (<a href="setting_up_the_player.htm#Matching_Methods">Matching Mode</a> = ANY), <i>Entities 
 Remaining</i> will list all entities with white <i><strong>or</strong></i> 
 cream flowers.</p><p><img src="assets/images/multiple_states.gif" style="margin-right:8px;" width="131px" height="115px" border="0"></p>
 <p><strong>Note:</strong> While the majority of keys have their <a href="setting_up_the_player.htm#Matching_Methods">Matching Mode</a> set to 'ANY', if the Matching Mode happens to be set as 'AND', then the any Entities still within <i>Entities Remaining</i> must have all the selected states matched (scored). Following the example above this would mean the plant has white <i><strong>and</strong></i> cream flowers.</p>
