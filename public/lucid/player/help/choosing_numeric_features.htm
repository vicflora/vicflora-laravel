<h1>Choosing numeric features</h1>
<p>For numeric features, you must enter a value rather than choose from 
 a set of states. Length and width features, for example, may be treated 
 in Lucid keys as numeric rather than multi-state features.</p><p>Numeric features are preceded by an 
 edit box rather than a checkbox:</p>
 <p><img src="assets/images/numerics_dialog.png" width="328" height="180" border="0"></p>
 <p>To enter details about a numeric feature, click its edit box. A dialog 
 box will pop up into which you can type the appropriate value.</p>
 <p>You can enter single 
 values and ranges. Valid entries will be of the 
 form:</p><ul type="disc">
	
	<li><p>x (a single value)</p></li>
	
	<li><p>x-y (between x and y)</p></li>
	
	<li><p>&lt;x (less than x)</p></li>
	
	<li><p>&gt;y (greater than y)</p></li>
</ul><p>It's good practice when using numeric features to enter a range rather 
 than a single value if possible. For example, if a key to plants has a 
 feature <i>Leaf length</i>, it's better 
 to choose several typical leaves from your specimen and to enter the range 
 of leaf lengths found over those leaves (ignoring unusually small or unusually 
 large leaves) than to enter the length of a single leaf.</p>
 <p><strong>Note </strong>that the Lucid 
 Player assumes an accuracy for numeric values based on the number of decimal 
 places specified. For example, entering the value 10 (no decimal places) 
 will be read by Lucid as meaning the range between 9.5 and 10.5; entering 
 10.5 will be read as the range between 10.45 and 10.55. Hence, if you 
 enter the single value 10, an entity scored as having the value 9.6 will 
 be regarded as a match.</p>
