<h1>Finding the Best feature - The Best function</h1>
<p>Once one or more states have been chosen and the list of <i>Entities 
 Remaining</i> has been reduced, some features may be more useful for 
 the next step in the identification process than others. For example, some features may be scored the 
 same for all entities remaining, in which case choosing a state of that 
 feature would not contribute to the identification.</p>
 <p>Lucid has a <i>Best</i> algorithm 
 for determining which is the best feature to address at <b>any stage</b> during 
 an identification session. In general, a feature that would, on average, 
 cause the list of <i>Entities Remaining</i> 
 to be halved is a good feature to address.</p><p><i><strong>Find 
 Best</strong></i> will determine which is the best feature to address next, 
 and jump to and open that feature in <i>Features 
 Available</i>.</p> 
 <p>Find the best feature to address next by clicking the <i>Best</i> 
 button <img src="assets/images/findbest.gif" width="25px" height="25px" border="0" alt="Find Best icon"> on the toolbar.</p><p>If the list of entities in <i>Entities 
 Remaining</i> changes after choosing a feature as suggested by <i>Best</i>, it may be worth clicking the 
 <i>Best</i> button again to recalculate 
 the next best feature to address.</p>
 <p><i>Best</i> can be automated, so that it is recalculated after each feature is addressed. Choose the option 
 <i>Automate</i>&gt;<i>Auto Best</i> from the key settings page, <i>if one has been provided</i>.</p>
 <p><b>Tip:</b> If you need to choose several states from one feature when <i>Auto Best</i> 
 is on, hold down the <i>Control</i> key when choosing the states – <i>Auto Best</i> 
 will be paused until the <i>Control</i> key is released.</p>
