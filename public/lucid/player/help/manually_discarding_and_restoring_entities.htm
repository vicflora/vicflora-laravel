<h1>Manually discarding and restoring Entities</h1>
<h2>Please note: This feature is not yet available in the JavaScript based Lucid Player</h2>
<p>During most Lucid identification sessions, Entities will be removed 
 from Entities Remaining to Entities Discarded as a result of the Feature 
 states you choose. However, you may sometimes find it useful to manually 
 remove Entities that you know well and are certain do not match your specimen. 
 Manually removing Entities that you know cannot match will make some functions 
 (such as <a href="finding_the_best_feature_-_the_best_function.htm">Best</a> and <a href="finding_the_best_feature_-_the_best_function.htm">Prune Redundants</a>) work more efficiently. </p>
 <p>Entities are manually discarded by dragging them from Entities Remaining 
 to Entities Discarded. Manually discarded Entities are indicated by red 
 text. To restore manually discarded Entities, drag the manually discarded 
 Entities back to the Entities Remaining windows. Manually discarded Entities 
 will also be restored if the key is restarted.</p>
