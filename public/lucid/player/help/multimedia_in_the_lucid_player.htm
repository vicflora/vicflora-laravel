<h1>Multimedia in the Lucid Player</h1><p>Many Lucid keys provide images and web pages for features, states and 
 entities, to help make an identification easier and more accurate and 
 to provide extra information on the items in the key. For example, web 
 pages and images attached to features and states may help you decide which 
 state of a feature to choose, or provide background hints and tips on 
 difficult features. Similarly, web pages and images attached to entities 
 may provide descriptions and extra information on the entities in the 
 key, both to add to the available information and to help you choose whether 
 an identification is correct.</p>

 <p>By default, items in the Features and Entities panels that have images 
 attached will be preceded by the <img src="assets/images/imagemedia_16.gif" width="16px" height="16px" border="0" alt="Image icon"> icon, while items that 
 have web pages (A.K.A. Fact sheets) attached will be preceded by the <img src="assets/images/htmlmedia_16.gif" width="16px" height="16px" border="0" alt="Html fact sheet icon"> icon.</p>
<p>Optionally, image thumbnails can be displayed in the Features and Entities 
 panels for items that have images attached. To display thumbnails check 
 either or both the <i>Feature Thumbnails</i> <img src="assets/images/featurethumbnailsicon.png" width="25px" height="25px" border="0" alt="Feature Thumbnail option icon"> or <i>Entities Thumbnail</i> <img src="assets/images/entitythumbnailsicon.png" width="25px" height="25px" border="0" alt="Entities Thumbnail option icon"> options located on the main toolbar.</p>
 
 <p>With the <i>Image Thumbnails</i> checked, features or 
 entities that have images attached will be preceded by a small thumbnail 
 of an image associated with that item. 
 <p>To view a web page or image attached to an item click on its icon or 
 thumbnail.</p></body>
