<h1>Pruning  the feature tree - The Prune Redundants function</h1>
<p>After a number of features have been chosen and the <i>Entities 
 Remaining</i> list has been substantially reduced, some features and 
 states may be redundant for the identification.</p><p>A state is considered redundant if it applies to none of the entities remaining, or to all of the entities remaining (choosing such a state 
 will either leave no entities or remove no entities, so it is ineffectual 
 to answer). A feature is redundant if all of its states are redundant.</p><p>The <i>Prune Redundants</i> function 
 will scan the features in <i>Features Available</i> 
 and remove any redundant features and/or states for the remaining entities. 
 This may be useful to "clean up" the list of features, to make it less 
 likely that a choice will be ineffectual.</p>
 <p><strong>Note</strong> that there is 
 one circumstance in which apparently redundant states may be left in after 
 pruning. Consider a 2-state feature, one state of which would remove some 
 remaining taxa, the other of which would remove none. The state that removes 
 no taxa is not logically redundant in this case, and would not be removed 
 since removing it would leave a character with only one state. 
 <strong></strong></p><p>To activate the <i>Prune Redundants</i> 
 function, choose <i>Prune Redundants</i> 
 button <img src="assets/images/prune_redundants.gif" width="25px" height="25px" border="0" alt="Prune Redundants icon"> on the toolbar.</p><p><i>Prune Redundants</i> can be automated, 
 so that it is recalculated after each feature is addressed. Choose the 
 option <i>Automate</i>&gt;<i>Auto Prune</i> 
 from key settings page, if available.</p>
 <p><b>Tip:</b> If you need to choose several states from one feature when <i>AutoPrune</i> 
 is on, hold down the <i>Control</i>  key when choosing the states – <i>AutoPrune</i> 
 will be paused until the <i>Control</i> 
 key is released.</p>
