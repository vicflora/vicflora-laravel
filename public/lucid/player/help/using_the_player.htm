</figure></p><p class="whs5"><b><i>Features Available</i></b> shows the features and states in the key. An identification 
 is performed by clicking on (and so ticking) score boxes alongside those 
 states that match the specimen being identified.</p><p>In some keys, features and their states will be illustrated by images  displayed next to the feature or state name. See the topic <a href="multimedia_in_the_lucid_player.htm">Multimedia in the Lucid Player</a> for more information.</p>
 <p><b><i>Features Chosen</i></b> shows the features 
 and states that have been used to describe the specimen being identified. 
 </p><p>When an identification is started this window will be empty; as features 
 are progressively selected in <i>Features 
 Available</i>, they are copied to <i>Features 
 Chosen</i> for handy reference.</p><p>To unchoose a previously chosen state, click on (and so un-tick) its 
 score box in <i>Features Chosen</i>.</p>
 <p><b><i>Entities Remaining</i></b> shows all entities that match the chosen features and 
 states.</p><p>In some keys, entities will be illustrated by images and web pages displayed 
 next to the entity name. In addition, a tab at the bottom of the Entities 
 panels provides access to a gallery of images for all remaining entities. 
 See the topic <a href="multimedia_in_the_Lucid_player.htm">Multimedia 
 in the Lucid Player</a> for more information.</p>
 <p><b><i>Entities Discarded</i></b> shows all 
 entities that do not match the chosen features and states.</p><p>The button bar and menu contains many options to help make an identification 
 easier. See the topic <a href="the_lucid_players_menu_and_button_bar.htm">The 
 Lucid Player’s Menu and Button Bar</a> for links to help on these.</p><p><strong>Tip:</strong> You can adjust the panel sizes by selecting the vertical or horizontal separator bars of the panels and moving them to your preferred size. For the Web browser player you can also use your browsers inbuilt zoom function to adjust the overall size of the player and key content. (e.g. Ctrl + +/-).</p>
