<h1>Why an entity was discarded - The Why Discarded function</h1>
<p>After choosing several states, entities which do not match the current selection are moved to the <i>Entities Discarded</i> window. To determine why an entity was discarded, select it from the Entities Discarded window then click on the <i>Why Discarded</i> button <img src="assets/images/whydiscarded_25.gif" width="25px" height="25px" border="0">on the toolbar.</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/why_discarded.png" width="402px" height="335px" border="0"></p>
<p>The <i>Why Discarded</i> dialog displays the list of selected features that do not match the selected entity. For each feature listed, the states you have chosen from the feature are displayed, along with the list of states scored for the entity in the key. </p>
<p>If an entity is discarded that you believe should still be present, the <i>Why Discarded</i> function allows you to quickly compare your selections with the features present for the entity in the key.</p>
