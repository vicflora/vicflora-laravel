<h1>About the Lucid Family of Products</h1><p>The Lucid family of products comprises a series of programs to help 
 build, deploy and use interactive, computer-based identification keys. 
 Lucid keys may be used to identify a wide range of objects or entities, 
 from plants and animals to diseases etc. Usually, an expert on a 
 particular subject uses a Lucid program to build an identification or 
 diagnostic key to the species or objects of interest to them – essentially 
 capturing their expert knowledge in the Lucid key. The key can then be 
 distributed, allowing other interested people to identify and learn about 
 the things in the key.</p><p>There are two main programs in the Lucid family - the Lucid Matrix and Lucid 
 Phoenix systems.</p>
