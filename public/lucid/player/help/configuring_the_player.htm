<h1>Configuring the Player</h1>
<h2>These options may only be available if the Author of the key has provided a settings option page with the key</h2>
<h2>Keeping subsets on restart</h2>
<p>By default, if you have chosen one or more <a href="using_subsets_of_features_and_entities.htm">subsets</a> 
 during an identification and you click the <i>Restart</i> 
 button, the subsets will be retained when the key is restarted. If instead you would like any subsets 
 to be reset (so the key is restarted using all features and entities), 
 uncheck the <i>Retain selected subsets on restart</i> option.</p>
 <h2><a name="Allowing_Misinterpretations"></a>Allowing misinterpretations</h2>
 <p>In Lucid keys, some entities may be scored as having a feature <i>by misinterpretation</i>. For example, 
 some groups of wasps are distinctive in having a strikingly narrowed section 
 or "waist" between the thorax and abdomen, while in other groups of wasps 
 and in most other insects there is no such narrowing. However, some members 
 of the "waisted" wasps, such as the common honeybee, have a very short 
 waist that is almost hidden by the other body segments and is easily overlooked. 
 </p><p>If a key to wasps has a feature <i>Waist 
 present/absent</i>, there is a danger that the waist on a honeybee 
 would be overlooked by a user who would incorrectly describe their specimen 
 as not having a waste. This could result in a misidentification.</p><p>To prevent such errors, the key’s builder will score the honeybee as 
 <i>Waist present</i> (true) and <i>Waist absent</i> (<i>by 
 misinterpretation</i>). The Lucid Player treats the by misinterpretation 
 score as though it were a true score, so the honeybee will be retained 
 in <i>Entities Remaining</i> even if 
 the waist is overlooked.</p><p>However, another user - who is more experienced in identification - 
 may wish to have such misinterpretations ignored and to only see a list 
 of all wasps that truly lack a waist. In this case, the honeybee should 
 be removed from <i>Entities Remaining</i>. 
 </p><p>The Lucid Player allows users to select these different modes of operation 
 through the <i>Allow Misinterpretations</i> 
 item of the <i>Key</i> menu. With <i>Allow Misinterpretations</i> checked (the 
 default behaviour), entities scored for a state using the by misinterpretation 
 score will remain in <i>Entities Remaining</i> 
 when the state is selected; with <i>Allow 
 Misinterpretations</i> turned off, such entities will be discarded.</p>
 <h2><a name="Retain_uncertain_entities"></a>Retaining uncertain entities</h2>
 <p>In Lucid keys, some entities may be scored as <i>Uncertain</i> 
 for some states. For example, a key to plants may include features concerning 
 fruits, but some rare species may never have been observed at the fruiting 
 stage when the key was being built. In this case the builder of the key 
 would score fruit features and states for such entities as <i>Uncertain</i>. 
 </p><p>In normal identifications, it is important for the Lucid Player to treat 
 entities scored as <i>uncertain</i> 
 for a state in the same way as entities scored <i>present</i> 
 for the state. Using the example above, a user of the key may have a specimen 
 of the rare species that does have fruits, and hence may be able to address 
 the fruit features. In such a case, the species should remain in <i>Entities Remaining</i> even though the 
 key builder could not properly score the fruit features.</p><p>However, another user may wish to have such uncertain scores ignored and to only see a list of all species that are <i>known</i> 
 to have fruits of a particular shape or colour. In this case, the species 
 with unknown fruits should be removed from <i>Entities 
 Remaining.</i></p>
 <p>The Lucid Player allows users to select these different modes of operation 
 through the <i>Retain Uncertains</i> option. With <i>Retain Uncertains</i> checked (the default 
 behaviour), entities scored for a state using the uncertain score will 
 remain in <i>Entities Remaining</i> when the state is selected; with <i>Retain 
 Uncertains</i> turned off, such entities will be discarded.</p>
 <h2><a name="Matching_Methods"></a>The Lucid Matching Methods</h2>
 <p>Lucid matches entities against selected features to determine which 
 entities match and which do not.</p><p>Two options, accessed through the <i>Match 
 Method</i> option of the <i>Key</i> menu, allow you to vary the way the Lucid Player handles the matching. 
 </p><p>Using the <i>Any State</i> matching method, entities will be kept in <i>Entities 
 Remaining</i> if they match any chosen state of a feature. Using the 
 <i>All States</i> matching method, entities will only be kept in <i>Entities Remaining</i> 
 if they match all chosen states of a feature.</p><p>To understand these modes, consider a feature <i>Flower 
 colour</i> with the following states:</p><p>Flower colour<br/>
white<br/>
red<br/>
blue<br/>
yellow</p><p>Consider three entities <i>e1</i>, 
 <i>e2</i> and <i>e3</i> 
 that have been scored by the key’s builder as follows: <i>e1</i> 
 has been scored for <i>blue</i> only, 
 <i>e2</i> has been scored for <i>yellow</i> only, while <i>e3</i> 
 has been scored for both <i>blue and yellow</i>.</p><p>Using the <i>Any State</i> match method 
 in the Player and choosing the state <i>blue</i>, 
 <i>e1</i> and <i>e3</i> 
 will remain in <i>Entities Remaining</i> 
 (since both are scored as having blue flowers) while <i>e2</i> 
 will be moved to <i>Entities Discarded</i>. 
 If you choose instead the state yellow, <i>e2</i> 
 and <i>e3</i> will remain in <i>Entities 
 Remaining</i> while <i>e1</i> will 
 be moved to <i>Entities Discarded</i>. 
 Finally, if you choose both states blue and yellow, all three entities 
 will remain in <i>Entities Remaining</i> 
 (that is, the Player is returning all entities scored for either blue 
 or yellow)</p><p>By contrast, using the <i>All States</i> 
 match method and choosing the state blue, only <i>e1</i> 
 will remain in <i>Entities Remaining</i> 
 (since only it is scored for only blue) and <i>e2</i> 
 and <i>e3</i> will be moved to <i>Entities Discarded</i>. If 
 you choose instead the state yellow, only <i>e2</i> 
 will remain in <i>Entities Remaining</i> 
 while e1 and e3 will be moved to <i>Entities 
 Discarded</i>. Finally, if you choose both states blue and yellow, 
 only <i>e3</i> will remain in <i>Entities Remaining</i> while <i>e1</i> 
 and <i>e2</i> will be moved to <i>Entities Discarded</i> (that is, the Player 
 is returning only entities scored for both blue <i>and 
 yellow</i>).</p><p>The normal matching method for most identifications is <i>Any 
 State</i>, as this allows more flexibility between the scores given 
 by the key’s builder and the answers provided during the identification. 
 In some circumstances, you may wish to change the mode to <i>All 
 States</i>. This can be done at any time. You should be careful to 
 understand how this method works before changing to it.</p><p><strong>Note</strong> also that some 
 authors may set All States as the default Match Method and have scored 
 their keys, such as diagnostic keys, on this basis. In 
 this case, changing the Match Method will cause the key to operate in 
 a very different way from that intended by the author.</p>
 <h2><a name="Sorting_Methods"></a>The Lucid Sorting Methods</h2>
<h2>Please note: This feature is not yet available in the JavaScript based Lucid Player</h2>
 <p>Lucid matches entities against each selected feature to determine which 
 entities match and which do not.</p><p>Two options, accessed through the <i>Sorting 
 Method</i> option of the <i>Entities</i> 
 menu, allow you to vary the way the Lucid Player reports the results 
 of the matching.</p><p>In a <i>Filtered</i> sort, entities 
 that do and do not match the selected features are sorted into two lists, 
 <i>Entities Remaining</i> and <i>Entities Discarded </i>respectively.</p><p>In a <i>Ranked</i> sort, all entities 
 are listed in the <i>Entities Remaining</i> 
 panel (and the <i>Entities Discarded</i> 
 panel is hidden). Entities are prefixed by their percentage match to the 
 selected features (when using the <i>Any 
 State</i> matching method) or selected states (when using the <i>All States</i> matching method). (For more 
 information on the matching methods, see the topic Lucid Matching methods 
 above)</p><p>The entities in a <i>Ranked</i> sort 
 are ranked by their percentage match value. For example, if an entity 
 matches all the selected features it will have a match value of 100% and 
 will appear in the top rank of the <i>Entities</i> 
 list. If another entity matches half the selected features (or states) 
 it will have a match value of 50% and will be ranked lower in the list.</p>

<h2><a name="Automating_Best_Prune"></a>Automating Best and Prune</h2>
<p>The <i><a href="finding_the_best_feature_-_the_best_function.htm">Best</a></i> and <i><a href="pruning_the_feature_tree_-_the_prune_redundants_function.htm">Prune Redundants</a></i> functions by default are only applied when you click the appropriate button or menu item.</p><p>However, you may automate these functions, so they are applied whenever a state is chosen. With these automated, after addressing each feature the <i>Features Available</i> list will be automatically pruned of redundant features.</p><p>To set <i>Best</i> and <i>Prune Redundants</i> to be automatically applied, check the <i>Auto Best</i> and <i>Auto Prune</i> from the <i>Automate</i> 
 section of the settings page.</p>
 <p>If you need to choose several states from one feature before applying the <i>Best</i> and <i>Prune functions</i>, hold down the <i>Control</i> key while choosing the states. The automated functions will be paused until the control key is released.</p>

 <h2><a name="Font_Size"></a>Font Size (Display Size)</h2>
 <p>If you wish to change the size of the text displayed with the Lucid Player, use the browsers inherent font size/page zoom feature to increase or decrease the display. For most browsers using Ctrl + [+|-] keys will perform this function.</p>
