<h1>Using  subsets of features and entities</h1>
<p><i>Subsets</i> are groups of features or entities pre-defined by the author of the key.</p><p>For example, feature subsets in a key to beetles may allow you to restrict <i>Features Available</i> to display 
 only wing features and head features, or all simple and easily observed 
 features. Entity subsets may allow you to restrict the <i>Entities</i> 
 panels to display only the beetles in a particular taxonomic subgroup, 
 or only common species. </p><p><i>Subsets</i> are particularly useful 
 for keeping <i>Features Available</i> 
 and the <i>Entities</i> panels free of unnecessary items. For example, if you have a key to plants and your 
 specimen has no fruits, it is useful to remove all fruit features using 
 subsets. Functions such as <i>Best</i> 
 will be more useful if you restrict <i>Features 
 Available</i> to show only features that it will be possible to address.</p><p>To choose a subset (if the key’s builder has specified subsets in the 
 key), open the <i>Subsets</i> list by 
 clicking the <i>Subsets</i> button <img src="assets/images/showsubsets_25.gif" width="25px" height="25px" border="0"alt="Subsets icon"> on the Toolbar.</p>
 <p><b>Note</b> that you may choose more than one subset.</p><p>If you are using subsets and need to keep the same subsets when you restart the key, make sure that the <i>Retain selected subsets on key restart?</i> 
 option is checked. If this item is unchecked, subsets will be set back to show all features and entities 
 when the key is restarted.</p>
