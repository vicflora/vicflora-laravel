<h1>Shortcuts  to an answer - The Shortcut function</h1>
<p>The <i>Shortcuts</i> function is similar to the <i>Best</i> functions in that  it may provide a quicker route to an identification. In <i>Shortcuts</i> 
 the Player searches for features that, if answered, would provide a 
 shortcut to an identification.</p>
<p>For example, consider a key to fish. After choosing a number of states, the list of <i>Entities Remaining</i> may have been reduced to 20 species. Some of those species may have unique features, or share a state with only one or two other species in the list. If you were to choose such a state, you would immediately shortcut to a single species or a very small number of species.</p>
<p>Shortcuts provides a way of finding such unique features. Find shortcuts by clicking the <i>View Shortcuts</i> 
 button <img src="assets/images/shortcutfeatures_25.gif" width="25px" height="25px" border="0"> on the Toolbar.</p>
 <p>A list of shortcut features will be opened. Scan the list for features 
 that match your specimen (of course, there may be no available shortcut, 
 in which case the <i>Shortcuts</i> list will be empty or the specimen being identified will not match any listed 
 feature). You may choose shortcut features by clicking on their score 
 boxes in the <i>Shortcuts</i> dialog.</p><p><img src="assets/images/shortcut_features.png" width="402px" height="277px" border="0"></p>
 <p><strong>Note</strong> The <i>Shortcuts</i> 
 function is similar to the <i>Bingo</i> function in previous editions of the Lucid Player.</p></body>
