<h1>About 
 Entities and Features</h1><p><i>Entities</i> in Lucid are the things 
 the key aims to identify. Depending on the scope of the key, the entities 
 may be different kinds of things. For example, in a key to the palms of 
 Brazil, the entities will be species of palms, in a key to the families 
 of flies of the world the entities will be fly families, in a key to minerals 
 the entities will be types of minerals, in a key to disorders of sweet 
 potatoes the entities will be the causes of disorders found in sweet potatoes. 
 In Lucid we use the term <i>entity</i> 
 because it applies to all the possible things that a key may be designed 
 to help identify. Lucid itself doesn"t know whether the entities are 
 species of plants, families of flies, minerals or diseases – they are 
 all simply entities to Lucid, and are all handled in the same way. </p>
 <p><i>Features</i> in Lucid are characteristics 
 of the entities in the key that can be used to describe each entity.</p>

 <p>For example, in a key to minerals one feature may be the types of crystalline 
 form shown by the mineral. Amongst the minerals in the key, there will 
 be a number of different crystal forms – cubic, tetragonal etc. The different 
 possibilities for crystal form are called states of the feature. States 
 of a feature are indicated in the Lucid Player by scoring boxes preceding 
 the state names. </p><p>In Lucid there are three main types of features.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;<i><img src="assets/images/feature_types.gif" width="363" border="0" height="151">
 </i></p><p><i>Multi-state features</i>, like 
 those shown for the crystal form of minerals, have two or more alternative 
 states. </p><p><i>Numeric features</i>, by contrast, 
 are ones in which real numbers (integer or decimal) are used to describe 
 the entities. &nbsp;Numeric 
 features are normally used for lengths, widths, ratios and counts. For 
 example, a key to butterflies may use a numeric feature for the length 
 of the forewing, or for the number of segments in the antennae.</p><p><i>Grouping features</i> are features 
 that contain other features.</p><div id="footer"><p>&nbsp;</p></div></div>
