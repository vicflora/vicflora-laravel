<h1>Comparing entities - The Differences function</h1>
<p>Suppose you have used the Player to try to identify a specimen, and  at the end of the keying session several entities remain.</p>
<p>One way of trying to decide which of these is correct would be to access 
 the information (photographs &amp; fact sheets) associated with the entities. 
 This may allow you to discriminate the entities further.</p><p>A better way may be to view a list of features that differ between the entities. You can access such a list by clicking the Differences <img src="assets/images/simdiffs_25.gif" width="25px" height="25px" border="0" alt="Differences icon"> button on the toolbar. This will open the <i>Differences</i> window.</p>
 <p>The <i>Differences</i> window has two panels. The upper panel lists contains a dropdown list of features that differ (that is, are not scored the same) for the remaining entities. When you select a specific 
 feature, the lower panel shows how the entities are scored for the listed features.</p>
 <p><i>Differences</i> in the upper panel are sorted by their utility for separating the entities, therefore it 
 is recommended you review the differences from the top down.</p><p>
