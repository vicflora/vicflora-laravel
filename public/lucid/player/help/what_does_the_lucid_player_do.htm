<h1>What does the Lucid Player do?</h1>
<p>The Lucid Player is an effective and powerful identification and diagnostic 
 tool. It is used to play interactive identification or diagnostic keys 
 or guides created using the <a href="http://www.lucidcentral.org/en-us/software/lucid3/lucidbuilder.aspx" target="_blank">Lucid3 Builder</a>.</p><p>Lucid3 keys are usually created by an expert for a particular group 
 of organisms or things (such as fruit flies, frogs, wild flowers, corals, 
 grasses, crop diseases, mouth ulcers or minerals). The key comprises a 
 list of all the entities (e.g. species or other taxa, objects, diseases 
 etc) in the group, a list of the features that may be used to identify 
 them, and a matrix of scores of the entities for the features.</p>
 <p>When a key is deployed in the Lucid Player, it can be used to identify 
 specimens that belong to the group covered. Specimens are described by 
 selecting, from the list of all features provided in the key, those features 
 that match the specimen. At each step, the Lucid Player sorts the list 
 of entities in the key into those that match the developing description 
 and those that do not. As features are progressively chosen, the list 
 of matching entities will be progressively reduced until a single entity 
 (or perhaps a short list of entities) remains. The identification is complete.</p>
 <p>Identifying the specimen – finding a name for it – is only the first 
 step in finding out more about it. Links from the key’s entities provide 
 access to fact sheets and other information provided by the key builder. 
 A name is also the starting point for finding information on an organism 
 beyond the key, using the Internet and other resources.</p>
 <p>The Lucid Player provides other tools and information to help with 
 the identification. For example, features in Lucid keys are usually provided 
 with explanatory notes and images to help learn about them. <a href="using_subsets_of_features_and_entities.htm">Sub-sets</a> 
 of features can help organise the list of features to make it easier to 
 manage, and the Player’s <a href="finding_the_best_feature_-_the_best_function.htm">Best</a> function is a powerful 
 tool to help decide which feature to address next.</p>
