    the Wild when exhaustive surveys in known and/or expected habitat, at

    Regionally extinct – Category for a taxon when there is no reasonable doubt

    if it is a former visiting taxon, the last individual has died or

    Data Deficient – A taxon is Data Deficient when there is inadequate
    information to make a direct, or indirect, assessment of its risk of
    extinction based on its distribution and/or population status. A taxon in
    this category may be well studied, and its biology well known, but
    appropriate data on abundance and/or distribution are lacking. Data
    Deficient is therefore not a category of threat. Listing of taxa in this
    category indicates that more information is required and acknowledges the
    possibility that future research will show that threatened classification
    is appropriate. It is important to make positive use of whatever data are
    available. In many cases great care should be exercised in choosing between
    DD and a threatened status. If the range of a taxon is suspected to be
    relatively circumscribed, and a considerable period of time has elapsed
    since the last record of the taxon, threatened status may well be justified.

    DD

    """
    Not Applicable – Category for a taxon deemed to be ineligible for assessment
    at a regional level. A taxon may be NA because it is not a wild population
    or not within its natural range in the region, or because it is a vagrant
    to the region. It may also be NA because it occurs at very low numbers in
    the region (i.e. when the regional Red List authority has decided to use a
    filter to exclude taxa before the assessment procedure) or the taxon may be
    classified at a lower taxonomic level (e.g. below the level of species or
    subspecies) than considered eligible by the regional Red List authority.
    In contrast to other Red List Categories, it is not mandatory to use NA for
    all taxa to which it applies; but is recommended for taxa where its use is
    informative.
